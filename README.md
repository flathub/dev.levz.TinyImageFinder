This app recursively find and filter by name images in selected path and show its previews.

## Rationale

Application developed at one day for self educating purpose to get more familiar with QML and cmake. Also I found no fast and convenient tools on Windows, Linux and macOS to filter and browse huge quantity of image previews - the thing I do often. This app is doing just this. Search algorithm is high level and straightforward, multi threaded and well scaling. The code is open source.

## Features

* Fast search and preview images from selected folder.
* Image name filters.
* Recursive search - find images in all subfolders.
